### Get started and understanding modern css3 layout called flexbox (Journey).

- [x] justify-content  
    defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container)
- [x] align-items  
    (sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group. In Flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis)
